Important next steps

Provide Contact Information
Add your contact information. This lets cPanel & WHM notify you about problems and status updates.

Customize Nameservers
Optionally, update your nameserver configuration. The system selects default nameservers during installation, but you can customize them before you create domains.

Customize Ethernet Device
Select or enter the Ethernet device that the system will add new IP addresses to.

DNS Cluster
DNS clustering separates your main server from the nameservers that handle DNS requests. This helps to prevent downtime and improve server performance.
